# SoftwareDesign_for_Visually_Impaired

# Problem
- It is a bit difficult for visually impaired people to access text information written on food products, home appliances, etc
- My main focus was on people who have weak eyesight, however, they HAVE the ability to see things
- People who struggle with Amblyopia their entire life, or ...

# Summary
- Overall, this mini-app could:
1. Convert text into speech when the user prefers to HEAR the text
2. Write down the text inside a text box so the person could make its font bigger and smaller (Some might prefer to read the text themselves and only a bigger fontsize may solve their problem)

# Process
- This simple user-interface can process a given image.
- Performs Optical Character Recognition to extract the text embedded in the image.
- Then, it converts text into speech, so the visually impaired person could HEAR the text, instead. 
- Eventually, the text is instantly written in a text box so if the user would prefer to access the text himself and make the font bigger for convenience.
